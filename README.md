# Autokey Cipher 
## Overview

This Python program implements the Autokey cipher, a classical encryption method that uses polyalphabetic substitution to encrypt and decrypt alphabetic text. Users can perform both encryption and decryption operations using a given plaintext or ciphertext along with an initial numeric cipher key.

## Features

- **Encryption and Decryption**: Users can encrypt plaintext or decrypt ciphertext.
- **Dynamic Key Generation**: The cipher key is generated dynamically based on the plaintext during encryption.
- **Input Validation**: Robust error handling ensures that the key input is a valid integer between 0 and 25.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple prompts guide users through the encryption and decryption processes.

## Usage
### Run the Program
Execute the script in your Python environment.

### Choose Operation
- Type `encryption` to encrypt text.
- Type `decryption` to decrypt text.

### Input
- For encryption: Enter the plaintext.
- For decryption: Enter the ciphertext.
- Enter your key (0-25)

### Output
The program will display the encrypted or decrypted text.
